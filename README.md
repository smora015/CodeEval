CodeEval
========

This repo is a compilation of my source code for challenge questions to CodeEval. The purpose of CodeEval Challenge 
s to further my skills in problem solving in Computer Science theory, as well as improve my skills in programming 
anguages, particularly (but not limited to,) C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and PHP. I plan to implement a site allowing the user to run each of the programs, starting off with the JavaScript challenges.

All of the challenges are solved using code written solely by me, Sergio Morales. See LICENSE for more info 
on usage permissions.
