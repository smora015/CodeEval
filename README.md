CodeEval
========

This repo is a compilation of my source code for challenge questions to CodeEval. The purpose of CodeEval Challenge is to further my skills in problem solving in Computer Science theory, as well as improve my skills in programming languages, particularly (but not limited to,) C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.

All of the challenges are solved using code written solely by me, Sergio Morales. See LICENSE for more info on usage permissions.
